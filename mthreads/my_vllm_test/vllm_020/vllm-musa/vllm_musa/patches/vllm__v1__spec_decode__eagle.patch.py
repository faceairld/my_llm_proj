MUSA-0090: Dispatch EagleProposer.propose to the MUSA full-loop graph runner.

This patch installs a wrapper on `vllm.v1.spec_decode.eagle.EagleProposer.propose`
that:
  1. On MUSA: try the EagleFullLoopRunner; fallback to vLLM's iterative path
     on any error.
  2. On CUDA: behave identically to upstream (no-op wrapper).
  3. Lazy-init the runner on the FIRST propose() call (after vLLM has set
     up everything else). Capture happens then; subsequent calls just
     replay.

Architecture:
  - Patches the EagleProposer class via attribute assignment (MONKEY-PATCH).
  - Uses an empty `PATCHES = []` so the parent `patches/__init__.py`'s
    file-mutation framework skips the find/replace pass. The side effects
    of importing this file (the monkey-patch) are what install the
    dispatcher.
  - Idempotent via the `_musa_eagle_patched` class attribute. Re-importing
    is safe — does not stack wrappers.

Rationale for MONKEY-PATCH over PATCHES = [(old, new)]:
  - MUSA-0089 confirmed the file-mutation framework is non-idempotent
    against new-block INSERTIONS (vs string replacements). The
    cuda_communicator.py patch accumulated 10 duplicate blocks across
    re-imports. INSERT semantics need either a marker-aware find pattern
    (fragile) or a different mechanism — monkey-patching is the
    different mechanism.
  - Class-level monkey-patch + marker attribute is exactly-once per
    process; the patches/__init__.py exec_module call from
    `_load_patch_config` runs side effects once, the marker prevents
    re-application within the same process if exec is re-triggered.
"""

PATCHES: list = []  # No file mutation; the dispatcher install is the side effect.

# vllm-musa's utils module installs a MUSA-Triton-adapted version of
# `eagle_prepare_next_token_padded_kernel` on vllm.v1.spec_decode.utils.
# If we import eagle here without first ensuring that monkey-patch has
# fired, eagle.py's `from vllm.v1.spec_decode.utils import ...` will
# bind to the UPSTREAM unpatched kernel, which then fails at MUSA
# Triton compile time with 'mismatched type for valid_count' inside
# eagle_prepare_next_token_padded_kernel. (Diagnosed via isolation test
# 21:41 confirming: with this patch.py disabled, MUSA-0089 v7 config
# boots fine + smoke PASSes; with this patch.py active but without the
# prime import, smoke FAILS in the Triton kernel.)
