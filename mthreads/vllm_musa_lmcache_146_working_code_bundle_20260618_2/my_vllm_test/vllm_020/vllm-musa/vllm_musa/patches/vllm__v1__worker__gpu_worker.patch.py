Patch for vllm.v1.worker.gpu_worker to support MUSA device type.

The vLLM V1 GPU worker only checks for device_config.device.type == "cuda",
which doesn't match for MUSA devices. This patch extends the check
to also accept "musa" device type.

Note: No patch is needed for torch.device("cuda:X") because torchada
automatically aliases it to torch.device("musa:X") when imported.
