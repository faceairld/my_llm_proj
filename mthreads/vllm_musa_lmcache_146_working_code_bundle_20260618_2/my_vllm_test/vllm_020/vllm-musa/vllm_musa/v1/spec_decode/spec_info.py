# MUSA-0090 step 2: Pre-allocated buffers + capture-context dataclasses for
# the Eagle3 full-loop runner.
#
# All fields are tensors (not Python lists), so the captured cudagraph can
# mutate them in-place via tensor ops without Python re-entry. Buffers are
# sized for the MAX captured batch size; smaller batches use the leading
# prefix.
